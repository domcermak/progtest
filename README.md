# progtest

This project is being created during my studies at Faculty of information technology CTU to be software developer.
It is meant to be record of tasks and its solutions, which are given to students at FIT CTU.

I do NOT recommend to other FIT CTU students to copy my solution(s). There is chance that it will be highlighted as copy and rated by 0 points.

## compile

C files are recommended to be compiled like `gcc -std=c99 -O2 filename.c`

C++ files are recommended to be compiled like `g++ -std=c++11 -O2 filename.cpp`

## tester

Tester is free to download and works for both C and C++ file testing.
Read me of tester is at the beggining of `tester.sh` file



## feedback

I will be happy for every response to this project. Even if you have some idea for better solution, find some bug (then create issue) or whatever.
